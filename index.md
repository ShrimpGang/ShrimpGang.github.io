## Current Area of Interest: Brightwood
the area of interest is where you should be running your faction pvp missions in a group so that we can start taking control of that area.

## How does Shrimp Gang work?
we recruit new members to a Baby Shrimp company. all members in Baby Shrimp are officers and can recruit new members. running pvp missions with the groups will get you a place in the war. because initiating a war costs money, there are dues required once we are close to declaring war. You will be placed into the Shrimp Gang No Limp Gang company when it is time to go to war and benefit from your efforts of claiming land for the faction.
